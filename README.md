# Components Documentation

## MainPage Component

The `MainPage` component serves as the main entry point for the application, rendering the navigation bar (`NavBar`) along with the sections for history (`History`) and teams (`Teams`).

### Usage
```jsx
<MainPage />
```

### Props
This component does not accept any props.

### Structure
- `NavBar`: Renders the navigation bar at the top of the page.
- `History`: Renders the section for displaying historical information.
- `Teams`: Renders the section for displaying team information.

### Patterns Used
1. **Component Composition**: The `MainPage` component utilizes component composition by incorporating other components (`NavBar`, `History`, `Teams`) to build the overall UI. This promotes reusability and maintainability by breaking down the UI into smaller, reusable components.

2. **Flexbox Layout**: The use of flexbox (`flex`) and flex alignment properties (`justify-around`, `items-center`) allows for easy arrangement and alignment of elements within the navigation bar. This promotes responsiveness and consistent layout across different screen sizes.

3. **Overflow Control**: The `overflow-scroll` class ensures that if the content within the `MainPage` component exceeds the viewport height, it becomes scrollable. This prevents content overflow and ensures a better user experience.

## NavBar Component

The `NavBar` component represents the navigation bar of the application, providing links to navigate to different sections of the page.

### Usage
```jsx
<NavBar Title="Page Title" />
```

### Props
- `Title`: The title displayed on the navigation bar.

### Structure
- The navigation bar consists of two main sections:
  1. Title Section: Displays the title of the page.
  2. Navigation Links: Provides links to different sections of the page.

### Patterns Used
1. **Fixed Positioning**: The navigation bar is fixed at the top of the viewport (`top-0 left-0 right-0`), ensuring it remains visible while scrolling through the page. This improves navigation accessibility for users.

2. **Flexbox Layout**: The use of flexbox (`flex`) and flex alignment properties (`justify-around`, `items-center`) allows for easy arrangement and alignment of elements within the navigation bar. This promotes responsiveness and consistent layout across different screen sizes.

3. **Dynamic Content**: The title (`Title`) and navigation links are dynamically rendered based on the provided props. This promotes reusability and customization of the navigation bar component.

4. **Semantic HTML**: Semantic HTML elements such as `<nav>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>` are used to enhance the accessibility and SEO-friendliness of the navigation bar.

## History Component

The `History` component represents a section of the webpage dedicated to displaying historical information. It includes a carousel of images that can be navigated through.

### Usage
```jsx
<History />
```

### Props
This component does not accept any props.

### Structure
- The `History` component consists of two main sections:
  1. Title and Content Section: Displays the title and content describing the historical information.
  2. Carousel Section: Renders a carousel or an accordion based on the screen size.

### Patterns Used
1. **State Management with useState Hook**: The component utilizes the `useState` hook to manage the state of the currently selected image index (`Imagesindex`). This state is updated when the user interacts with the carousel or accordion items.

2. **Conditional Rendering**: The component conditionally renders either a carousel or an accordion based on the screen size (`isMobile`). This ensures a responsive layout where the appropriate UI component is displayed based on the device's screen width.

3. **Dynamic Styles**: The component dynamically calculates and applies styles to elements such as the background image of the section (`style`). This allows for a visually appealing presentation of the historical information.

4. **Event Handling**: Event handling functions (`indexer`) are used to handle user interactions, such as clicking on carousel items or accordion panels. These functions update the component's state to reflect the user's actions.

5. **Component Composition**: The `History` component is composed of multiple child elements, including the title, content, carousel/accordion, and carousel indicators. This promotes modularity and reusability, making the component easier to maintain and extend.

6. **Memoization**: The component is memoized using `React.memo()` to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders when the component's props or state do not change.

7. **decomposition pattern**: i made sure to break alll the problems into sub problem and now composing them to form a whole page

## Teams Component

The `Teams` component represents a section of the webpage dedicated to displaying information about teams or groups. It includes a list of teams, their schedules, and a footer with copyright information.

### Usage
```jsx
<Teams />
```

### Props
This component does not accept any props.

### Structure
- The `Teams` component consists of several sections:
  1. Team Navigation: Displays a list of team names as navigation links.
  2. Schedule: Lists the schedule of events for the selected team.
  3. Footer: Displays copyright information and a footer menu.

### Patterns Used
1. **Semantic HTML**: Semantic HTML elements such as `<section>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<footer>`, and `<p>` are used to structure the component, enhancing accessibility and SEO.

2. **Flexbox Layout**: Flexbox (`flex`) is utilized for layout and alignment of elements within the section, providing a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

3. **Conditional Styling**: CSS classes are conditionally applied to navigation links and schedule items to indicate active or hovered states, enhancing user interactivity and feedback.

4. **Dynamic Content**: The component renders dynamic content such as team names and schedule events, allowing for flexibility and customization based on the application's data.

5. **Responsive Design**: The component is designed to be responsive, adjusting its layout and styling based on the screen size to ensure optimal viewing experience across devices.

6. **Memoization**: The component is memoized using `React.memo()` to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders when the

 component's props or state do not change.
